- [ ] Connection pooling is configured (if needed)

## Build Configuration

- [ ] Build command is set to `npm run build`
- [ ] Output directory is set to `.next`
- [ ] Install command is set to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- [ ] Node.js version is set to 18.x or higher

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Images are optimized and use efficient formats
- [ ] Static assets are properly placed in the `public` directory
- [ ] Caching headers are configured for static assets

- Ensure database is accessible from Vercel
- Check database user permissions
- Verify Prisma client is generated during build

### API Timeouts

- Check DeepSeek API status
- Implement retry logic for API calls
- Ensure API keys are valid
- Consider increasing function timeout in Vercel

### Authentication Problems
