# Understanding Personality Traits

This guide provides a deeper understanding of the five personality traits measured in Aura's personality assessment.

## Scientific Background

The Five-Factor Model emerged from decades of research in personality psychology. It has been validated across cultures and shows good reliability over time. While no personality model is perfect, the Five-Factor Model provides a scientifically sound framework for understanding key aspects of human personality.

Aura's assessment is designed to give you accurate insights based on this established model, helping you better understand yourself and how you relate to the world around you.
