# Interpreting Your Test Results

This guide will help you understand and make the most of your Aura personality assessment results.

## Reading Your Results Page

After completing a personality test, your results page will show:

1. **Trait Scores**: Visual representation of your scores on the five personality traits
2. **Personality Insights**: Initial insights based on your trait scores
3. **AI-Generated Insights**: Deeper analysis of your personality (if generated)
4. **Test Completion Date**: When you took the test

### Trait Score Visualization

Each trait is displayed with:
- A score from 1 to 5
- A progress bar showing where you fall on the spectrum
- The trait name (Openness, Conscientiousness, etc.)

Remember that these scores are not "good" or "bad" - they simply describe different aspects of your personality.

## What Your Scores Mean

### Score Ranges

- **1.0-2.0**: Low range for this trait
- **2.1-3.9**: Moderate range for this trait
- **4.0-5.0**: High range for this trait

### Contextualizing Your Results

When interpreting your results, consider:

1. **Self-Perception vs. Reality**: Your scores reflect how you see yourself, which may differ from how others perceive you
2. **Situational Factors**: Your personality may express differently across various contexts (work, home, social settings)
3. **Cultural Influences**: Cultural background can affect how traits are expressed and valued
4. **Personal Growth**: Your traits may evolve slightly over time, especially with intentional development

## Using AI-Generated Insights

The AI-generated insights provide a deeper analysis of your personality based on:
- Your trait scores
- Patterns in your specific answers
- Combinations of traits that create unique personality aspects

To get the most from these insights:

1. **Read with an open mind**: Some insights may surprise you or reveal blind spots
2. **Look for patterns**: Notice themes that appear across different insights
3. **Consider applicability**: Reflect on how the insights apply to different areas of your life
4. **Use as a starting point**: The insights are meant to prompt reflection, not define you completely

## Beyond the Test

Your Aura personality assessment is a valuable tool, but remember:

1. **You are more than your traits**: Personality is just one aspect of who you are
2. **Context matters**: How traits express themselves varies by situation
3. **Growth is possible**: While core tendencies remain, you can develop in any direction
4. **Use as a guide**: Let your results inform but not dictate your choices
