# Frequently Asked Questions

## About the Test

### Q: How long does the personality test take to complete?
**A:** The standard test takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. We've designed it to be thorough yet efficient, respecting your time while gathering enough information for accurate results.

### Q: Is the test scientifically validated?
**A:** Yes, Aura's personality assessment is based on the Five-Factor Model (also known as the "Big Five"), which is one of the most scientifically validated frameworks for personality assessment. This model has been extensively researched and validated across different cultures and demographics.

### Q: How accurate are the results?
**A:** The accuracy depends on several factors:
- How honestly you answer the questions
- Your level of self-awareness
- Your current state of mind when taking the test

For most users who answer honestly, the results provide a reasonably accurate reflection of their personality traits. However, no personality test is 100% accurate, and results should be viewed as a helpful framework rather than an absolute truth.

### Q: Can I retake the test?
**A:** Yes, you can take the test as many times as you'd like. In fact, we recommend retaking it every 6-12 months, as your self-perception and certain aspects of your personality may evolve over time.

### Q: Will my answers be saved if I close the browser before finishing?
**A:** No, your answers are not saved if you close the browser before completing the test. Please make sure you have enough time to complete the test in one session.

## Results and Interpretation

### Q: What do the numbers in my results mean?
**A:** Each trait is scored on a scale from 1 to 5:
- 1-2: Low range for this trait
- 2.1-3.9: Moderate range for this trait
- 4.0-5.0: High range for this trait

These scores indicate where you fall on the spectrum for each personality trait.

### Q: Are high scores better than low scores?
**A:** No, higher scores are not inherently better or worse than lower scores. Each point on the spectrum has its own strengths and potential challenges. For example, high extraversion might be beneficial in social careers but could be challenging in roles requiring long periods of solitary focus.

### Q: Why do my results seem contradictory in some areas?
**A:** Human personality is complex and sometimes contains apparent contradictions. For example, you might score high on both openness (suggesting creativity) and conscientiousness (suggesting structure), which might seem contradictory but actually represents a balanced approach. Additionally, different traits can express themselves differently depending on the context.

### Q: How are the AI insights generated?
**A:** The AI insights are generated using DeepSeek's advanced language model, which analyzes:
- Your specific pattern of trait scores
- The combinations of traits that create your unique profile
- Your individual responses to test questions
- Scientific research on personality psychology

The AI is designed to provide personalized, nuanced insights rather than generic descriptions.

## Account and Privacy

### Q: Who can see my test results?
**A:** By default, only you can see your test results. If you choose to share your results using the "Share Results" feature, anyone with the link can view those specific results, but they cannot access your account or other personal information.

### Q: How long do shared result links remain active?
**A:** Shared result links expire after 30 days by default. This is to protect your privacy. If you want to share your results after this period, you can generate a new link.

### Q: Can I delete my results or account?
**A:** Yes, you can delete individual test results from your history page. To delete your entire account, go to your profile settings and select "Delete Account." This will permanently remove all your data from our system.

### Q: How is my data protected?
**A:** We take data protection seriously:
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties
- Test results are stored securely and associated only with your account
